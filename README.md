## Do you need an API, and also value your time?
**Apiary is for you!** Select any combination of categories and API options to quickly and easily sift through hundreds of public APIs. Want to see Animal APIs and Weather APIs? You got it. Want to sort those results for CORS support? Go ahead! If Apiary cannot satisfy your API needs, it will even express its sympathy for your plight.

## 'I need an idea, but I don't have one'
**Apiary has one for you!** The Randomizer located below the sorting options will give you two random APIs to think about combining. Sometimes, it's funny! Hit the shuffle button to get new APIs.

## About
Apiary is a student project created to help other students — or anyone — easily find public APIs and save them some of the trouble of combing through long lists while keeping track of details like auth schemes and CORS support. It utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and this API by Dave Machado: https://github.com/davemachado/public-api. It looks best in Firefox. It likes you and hopes you succeed.
